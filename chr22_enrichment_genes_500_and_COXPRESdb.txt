The proportion of the 500 most strongly positively correlated genes (from the NIH data set) that were located on Chromosome 22 (COMT location) and that overlapped with the 500 most strongly co-expressed genes from COXPRESdb http://coxpresdb.jp/ was significantly greater in all brain areas except pons than the overall proportion of the top 500 positively correlated genes from the NIH data set that were located on Chromosome 22 (note: this latter set did not include the requirement that they overlap with the COXPRESdb genes). In other words, genes for which there were two sources of positive COMT-coexpression evidence (NIH data and COXPRESdb data) were enriched on Chromosome 22. This could be an indication of sharing transcription factors.

Note; The confidence level was Bonferroni-corrected [1 - (.05/4)]
